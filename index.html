    <h2 id="Intro"> Introduction </h2>
        <p id="p2" class="p1">
            Hi, my name is Caitlin Lindauer. To start of I am an aspiring Web developer and you are visiting my first big web page! This site was made with a lot of time, effort, and some serious back and forth coding.
            When I used to think about how amazing, fun, and intimidating the whole coding world was and is I never really saw myself actively trying to join that world. After much deliberation here I am.
        </br>
            I was born and, (for the most part), raised in southern California. When I was really little my family moved around every couple of months while my dad was in the air force.
            Seeing as I have no recollection of that period of my life I normaly claim that I was born and raised in California. My parents meet in college, got married about a year later, then that following year I was born.
            In my family I have five younger siblings with the youngest being eleven years younger than me.
        </br>
            Outside of my endevor to learn the vast world of code I have a large aray of things I dable in. For starters, I love just about any form of art. From playing the guitar to sketching anime characters,
            writing intense not so short stories that I can never really complete to baking. I love playing sports but only as a fun thing with friends and family. Recently I have been getting more and more into 
            a variety of board games. Which hobbies I am currently into doing can change back and forth, but I never stop loving those activities.
