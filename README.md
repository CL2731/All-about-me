# All-about-me
Site Summary
This website is intended to provide a small introduction to me. It contains a photos, summary of who I am, two projects that I worked, and a few ways to get to know more about me as well as get ahold of me.

Here are the links provided on the website:

This code is used to style the navigation links at the top of the page. It changes the cursor to take on the appearance of a pointer as well as transitions the background to a lighter color to let the user know that the application they are hovering is active.

The purpose of this code is to make sure that when the screen this website is being viewed on gets to small, the images will not disappear off the screen.
